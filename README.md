iOS App for IMB's Watson Developer Challenge

ios-app folder:
   * This contains a basic iOS from [Watson's Quickstart iOS guide](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk/blob/master/Quickstart.md).
   * The only interesting code is in ViewController.swift
   * I stood up an app on the IBM BlueMix site, which appears to be how you get instances of the Watson services. The credentials in the code are tied to that.
